What Is This?

This simple mod adds the ability to break open cans of food on rocks.

Just walk up to any rock (one that you can mine with a pickaxe or create a bone knife out of) and use your can on it to break it open. Just be aware that you will lose 50-80% of the contents by doing this, so it should really only be used as a last resort.

To change the % lost when breaking the can open on rocks you can modify the code in ActionOpenCanEnv.c - specifically MIN_LOSS and MAX_LOSS. As with all my mods, repacking is allowed - do what you want with it.

Installation Instructions:

Install this mod like any other mod - copy it into your server folder and add it to your mods list. Make sure to copy the .bikey into your server keys.

Known Issues:
- Currently makes no sound when banging the can on the rock - will look into adding sound effects when I have time.

Repack & Source Code:

You may repack this mod if you like, and do anything else you want with it for that matter. Just keep in mind any future updates I make including bugfixes and improvements won't be applied to repacked mods, so make sure to check back for new versions if you notice any bugs or want to update. The source code is on my GitHub at www.zenarchist.io

Enjoy!
